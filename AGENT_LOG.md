## 2026-03-13 — RAL-66 — Plan used invalid `--project-ref` flag for `supabase db push`
**What was confusing / wrong:** The plan specified `supabase db push --project-ref hpubamqxoeckzrbvgsof`, but `db push` doesn't accept `--project-ref`. It pushes to the linked project by default (`--linked`). Also, prior migrations weren't in the remote history table, requiring `supabase migration repair --status applied <version> --linked` for each one before the new migration could be pushed.
**File/folder affected:** `.claude/plans/RAL-66.md`
**What I did:** Ran `supabase migration repair` for 5 prior migrations, then `supabase db push` (no `--project-ref`). Migration applied successfully.
**Suggested fix:** Future plans should use `supabase db push` (no `--project-ref`) and note that migration history may need repairing if local migration files were added without being pushed.
**Status:** Fixed

## 2026-03-13 — RAL-63 — No issues found

## 2026-03-13 — RAL-61 — Fixed duplicate guard silently blocking all pre-gen calls
**What was confusing / wrong:** The pre-gen `useEffect` in Dashboard.tsx was calling `generate-unit → next_section` correctly, but the edge function's duplicate guard (`is_pending_feedback = true AND is_bonus = false`) was finding the currently-displayed unit and returning early — no unit N+1 was ever created. Additionally, after feedback, `setUiState(null)` caused the dashboard query to drive state directly to `"pending_feedback"` (showing the pre-gen unit immediately), bypassing the "up_to_date" menu the user needs to see.
**File/folder affected:** `supabase/functions/generate-unit/index.ts`, `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`
**What I did:** (1) Pass `current_section_number` in the pre-gen call body; guard now filters `section_number > current_section_number` when present. (2) Changed `setUiState(null)` → `setUiState("up_to_date")` in `handleFeedback` so the menu always shows after feedback. (3) Added `activeCycle: { id: unit.cycle_id }` to the pending-unit query branch so the active-cycle menu variant renders correctly. Updated `supabase/functions/CLAUDE.md` duplicate guard docs.
**Status:** Fixed

## 2026-03-13 — RAL-61 — Updated duplicate guard docs in CLAUDE.md
**What was confusing / wrong:** `supabase/functions/CLAUDE.md` described the duplicate guard as matching "any non-bonus `is_pending_feedback` unit" without mentioning the new `current_section_number` filter. After adding the section-number-aware guard, the docs needed updating.
**File/folder affected:** `supabase/functions/CLAUDE.md`
**What I did:** Updated duplicate guard bullet to document both paths (with and without `current_section_number`). Updated pre-gen bullet to note that `current_section_number` is now passed.
**Status:** Fixed

## 2026-03-13 — RAL-60 — Removed dual pre-gen race condition, updated docs
**What was confusing / wrong:** After adding the client-side display trigger (Step 2), the server-side cascade in `generate-unit` was still active, creating a race where both mechanisms fired before either unit existed in the DB — producing duplicate units that broke the cascade for subsequent sections. Also, `supabase/functions/CLAUDE.md` still described the server-side cascade as active.
**File/folder affected:** `supabase/functions/generate-unit/index.ts`, `supabase/functions/CLAUDE.md`, `supabase/CLAUDE.md`
**What I did:** Removed the server-side cascade block from `generate-unit`. Updated `generate-unit` docs: replaced "Server-side pre-gen" bullet with "Pre-gen triggered by client", updated rate limit bullet to note background token is legacy. Updated `INTERNAL_BACKGROUND_SECRET` env var description in `supabase/CLAUDE.md`.
**Status:** Fixed

## 2026-03-13 — RAL-52 — No issues found

## 2026-03-13 — RAL-48 — Updated CLAUDE.md for unit_role column and section numbering
**What was confusing / wrong:** `supabase/functions/CLAUDE.md` did not document the section numbering logic for supplemental vs main units, nor the new `unit_role` column.
**File/folder affected:** `supabase/functions/CLAUDE.md`
**What I did:** Added two bullet points documenting section numbering rules and the `unit_role` column mapping.
**Status:** Fixed

## 2026-03-13 — RAL-44 — Updated CLAUDE.md docs for OWNER_EMAIL env var
**What was confusing / wrong:** `supabase/CLAUDE.md` and `supabase/functions/CLAUDE.md` did not document the `OWNER_EMAIL` env var or the owner rate limit override. Also, `_shared` folder was missing from the structure diagram in `supabase/CLAUDE.md`.
**File/folder affected:** `supabase/CLAUDE.md`, `supabase/functions/CLAUDE.md`, `dailyprong-web/CLAUDE.md`
**What I did:** Added `OWNER_EMAIL` to all three env var docs and updated the rate limit description in `functions/CLAUDE.md`.
**Status:** Fixed

## 2026-03-13 — RAL-49 — No issues found

## 2026-03-13 — RAL-47 — No issues found

## 2026-03-13 — RAL-43 — No issues found

## 2026-03-13 — RAL-45 code review cleanup
**What was confusing / wrong:** `src/hooks/CLAUDE.md` listed `generationError` in the `useUnitGeneration` exports, which was removed as dead state in this cleanup.
**File/folder affected:** `src/hooks/CLAUDE.md`
**What I did:** Removed `generationError` from the hook table row to match the updated interface.
**Status:** Fixed

## 2026-03-13 — RAL-41 — Updated CLAUDE.md docs for server-side pre-gen
**What was confusing / wrong:** `supabase/functions/CLAUDE.md` did not document `INTERNAL_BACKGROUND_SECRET` env var, the duplicate guard, server-side pre-gen triggers, or `process-feedback`'s new pre-gen + stale deletion behavior. `src/hooks/CLAUDE.md` still listed `isPreGenerating` and `startBackgroundGeneration` exports.
**File/folder affected:** `supabase/CLAUDE.md`, `supabase/functions/CLAUDE.md`, `src/hooks/CLAUDE.md`
**What I did:** Updated all three docs to reflect the new server-side pre-gen architecture.
**Status:** Fixed

## 2026-03-13 — RAL-42c — No issues found

## 2026-03-13 — RAL-42b — No issues found

## 2026-03-13 — RAL-42 — No issues found

## 2026-03-13 — RAL-40 Add motivational copy — No issues found

## 2026-03-13 — RAL-37 — Updated process-feedback CLAUDE.md for level_changed return field
**What was confusing / wrong:** `supabase/functions/CLAUDE.md` did not document the return value of `process-feedback`. After adding the `level_changed` field to the response, the docs needed a `Returns` line.
**File/folder affected:** `supabase/functions/CLAUDE.md`
**What I did:** Added `Returns` line documenting `{ success: true, level_changed: boolean }`.
**Status:** Fixed

## 2026-03-13 — RAL-36 — No issues found

## 2026-03-13 — RAL-35 — No issues found

## 2026-03-12 — RAL-34 — No issues found

## 2026-03-12 — RAL-27 — Updated hooks CLAUDE.md for background pre-generation
**What was confusing / wrong:** `src/hooks/CLAUDE.md` listed `useUnitGeneration` with only 5 exports and "4 actions". After adding `isPreGenerating`, `startBackgroundGeneration`, and noting `extra_resources` as a 5th action, the docs needed updating.
**File/folder affected:** `src/hooks/CLAUDE.md`
**What I did:** Updated the hook table row to include new exports and corrected the action count to 5.
**Status:** Fixed

## 2026-03-12 — RAL-32 — Updated CLAUDE.md for new extra_resources action
**What was confusing / wrong:** `supabase/functions/CLAUDE.md` said generate-unit "Supports 4 actions" and the action table only listed 4. After adding `extra_resources` as a 5th action, the docs needed updating.
**File/folder affected:** `supabase/functions/CLAUDE.md`
**What I did:** Updated action count to 5 and added `extra_resources` row to the action table.
**Status:** Fixed

## 2026-03-12 — RAL-33 — Plan claimed Tooltip imports not needed
**What was confusing / wrong:** The plan stated "No new imports needed — Tooltip/TooltipTrigger/TooltipContent are already available via the global provider." This conflates `TooltipProvider` (which wraps the app in App.tsx) with the actual `Tooltip`, `TooltipTrigger`, and `TooltipContent` components, which must be imported to use in JSX.
**File/folder affected:** `.claude/plans/RAL-33.md`, `src/pages/Onboarding.tsx`
**What I did:** Added the necessary Tooltip component imports to Onboarding.tsx.
**Suggested fix:** Plans should note that `TooltipProvider` being global does NOT eliminate the need to import Tooltip sub-components.
**Status:** Fixed

## 2026-03-12 — RAL-31 — Scrollbar track offset finally fixed with margin-top
**What was confusing / wrong:** The textarea scrollbar track in Mentor.tsx was bleeding under the `h-5` overlay div. Multiple prior attempts used `padding-top` on `::-webkit-scrollbar-track`, which has no effect in WebKit. Took several iterations to discover that `margin-top` is the correct property for offsetting scrollbar tracks in WebKit.
**File/folder affected:** `src/pages/Mentor.tsx`
**What I did:** Changed `[&::-webkit-scrollbar-track]:pt-5` → `[&::-webkit-scrollbar-track]:mt-5` in the `TEXTAREA_BASE` constant.
**Suggested fix:** Remember: WebKit scrollbar pseudo-elements ignore `padding` — use `margin` to offset track/thumb positioning.
**Status:** Fixed

## 2026-03-12 — RAL-30 — Model swap gemini-2.0-flash → gemini-2.5-flash-lite
**What was confusing / wrong:** CLAUDE.md files all still referenced `gemini-2.0-flash` — correctly matched the code at the time. Updated all docs to match the new `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` model.
**File/folder affected:** `dailyprong-web/CLAUDE.md`, `supabase/functions/CLAUDE.md`, all 3 edge functions
**What I did:** Replaced model string in generate-unit, mentor-chat, onboarding-chat edge functions + updated both CLAUDE.md files. Deployed all 3 functions.
**Status:** Fixed

## 2026-03-12 — RAL-29 — scroll-area.tsx edit sanctioned by plan
**What was confusing / wrong:** CLAUDE.md says "do not edit" shadcn/ui files in `src/components/ui/`, but RAL-29 explicitly required editing `scroll-area.tsx` to add `mt-1` to the scrollbar track. Same pattern as RAL-21 (textarea.tsx). No CLAUDE.md change needed — the rule is correct in general.
**File/folder affected:** `src/components/ui/scroll-area.tsx`
**What I did:** Applied the `mt-1` fix as specified. Also added `pt-4` to Mentor.tsx message content div.
**Status:** Fixed

## 2026-03-12 — RAL-28 — No issues found

## 2026-03-12 — mentor-textarea-scrollbar-fix — No issues found

## 2026-03-12 — RAL-26 — No issues found

## 2026-03-12 — RAL-24 — No issues found

## 2026-03-12 — RAL-25 — CLAUDE.md said gemini-2.5-flash, updated to gemini-2.0-flash
**What was confusing / wrong:** `CLAUDE.md` (root + `supabase/functions/CLAUDE.md`) referenced `gemini-2.5-flash` as the current model. Switched to `gemini-2.0-flash` for higher free-tier RPD.
**File/folder affected:** `dailyprong-web/CLAUDE.md`, `supabase/functions/CLAUDE.md`
**What I did:** Updated all model references from `gemini-2.5-flash` → `gemini-2.0-flash` in both CLAUDE.md files and all 3 edge functions.
**Status:** Fixed

## 2026-03-12 — RAL-21d — No issues found

## 2026-03-12 — RAL-21c — No issues found

## 2026-03-12 — RAL-21b — No issues found

## 2026-03-12 — RAL-21a — No issues found

## 2026-03-12 — RAL-20 — src/CLAUDE.md provider stack was outdated
**What was confusing / wrong:** `src/CLAUDE.md` listed the provider stack ending at `BrowserRouter → Routes` but didn't mention `UnitGenerationProvider` (newly added). The hooks CLAUDE.md also had no entry for the new hook.
**File/folder affected:** `src/CLAUDE.md`, `src/hooks/CLAUDE.md`, `dailyprong-web/CLAUDE.md`
**What I did:** Added `UnitGenerationProvider` to the provider chain in `src/CLAUDE.md`, added hook table row in `src/hooks/CLAUDE.md`, updated hooks list description in root `CLAUDE.md`.
**Status:** Fixed

## 2026-03-12 — RAL-23 — No issues found

## 2026-03-12 — RAL-22 — No issues found

## 2026-03-12 — RAL-21 — textarea.tsx edit sanctioned by issue
**What was confusing / wrong:** CLAUDE.md says "do not edit" shadcn/ui files in `src/components/ui/`, but the issue explicitly required editing `textarea.tsx` for scrollbar styling. The rule is correct in general but scrollbar customization classes aren't part of the shadcn scaffold — they were added manually before.
**File/folder affected:** `src/components/ui/textarea.tsx`, `src/components/ui/CLAUDE.md`
**What I did:** Applied the scrollbar fix as specified. No CLAUDE.md change needed — the rule is still correct for most cases.
**Status:** Fixed

## 2026-03-12 — RAL-18+RAL-19 — No CLAUDE.md issues found
**Note:** Fixed Dashboard.tsx pending units query (broken `.eq("cycles.user_id", ...)` PostgREST syntax — RLS handles user scoping), selectPillar now shows unit directly, handleFeedback awaits state reload, cycle-end routes to `up_to_date` instead of `pillar_selection`, and added "Cycle Complete!" / "Final section" UI. Also added `setActiveCycle(null)` reset on no-active-cycle path to ensure correct heading.

## 2026-03-12 — RAL-17 — No issues found

## 2026-03-12 — RAL-16 — No issues found

## 2026-03-12 — RAL-15 — No issues found

## 2026-03-13 — RAL-51 — Model swap gemini-2.5-flash-lite → gemini-2.5-flash
**What was confusing / wrong:** CLAUDE.md files (root + supabase/functions/) still referenced `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`. Updated all docs to match the new `gemini-2.5-flash` model.
**File/folder affected:** `CLAUDE.md`, `supabase/functions/CLAUDE.md`
**What I did:** Updated 1 reference in `CLAUDE.md` and 3 references in `supabase/functions/CLAUDE.md`.
**Suggested fix:** N/A — fixed in this commit.
**Status:** Fixed

## 2026-03-13 — RAL-55 — Fixed inaccurate process-feedback cycle-end doc
**What was confusing / wrong:** `supabase/functions/CLAUDE.md` described process-feedback's cycle-end logic as "checks if all non-bonus units in the cycle have feedback" with a "main units = cycle_length" check. The actual code (line 98) triggers cycle completion specifically when a non-bonus `synthesis`-type unit receives feedback — no count check at all.
**File/folder affected:** `supabase/functions/CLAUDE.md`
**What I did:** Replaced the inaccurate description with the correct trigger: "Triggers cycle completion when a non-bonus `synthesis`-type unit receives feedback."
**Status:** Fixed

## 2026-03-13 — RAL-56 — Updated CLAUDE.md for stale cycle auto-skip
**What was confusing / wrong:** `supabase/functions/CLAUDE.md` described `new_cycle` as failing with an error if an active cycle exists. After replacing the hard error with an auto-skip to `'skipped'` status, the docs needed updating.
**File/folder affected:** `supabase/functions/CLAUDE.md`
**What I did:** Updated the `new_cycle` action table row to document the auto-skip behavior.
**Status:** Fixed

## 2026-03-13 — RAL-54 — No issues found

## 2026-03-13 — RAL-58 — Gemini model swap
**What was confusing / wrong:** CLAUDE.md tech stack line said "Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite" but the actual code used `gemini-2.5-flash` (no "Lite"). The tech stack description was already slightly out of sync with code before this change.
**File/folder affected:** `CLAUDE.md`, `supabase/functions/CLAUDE.md`
**What I did:** Updated all 3 edge functions to `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`, and updated both CLAUDE.md files to match.
**Status:** Fixed

## 2026-03-13 — RAL-46 reset-user-data — No issues found

## 2026-03-13 — RAL-46 addendum: delete_account mode — No issues found

## 2026-03-13 — RAL-62 — Section numbering doc updated
**What was confusing / wrong:** `supabase/functions/CLAUDE.md` said supplemental units "inherit the current main section count" — this was only true before the fix. After RAL-62 they now prefer `current_section_number` from the client, with `mainUnitsCount` as a fallback.
**File/folder affected:** `supabase/functions/CLAUDE.md`
**What I did:** Updated the section numbering bullet to reflect the new behavior.
**Status:** Fixed

## 2026-03-13 — RAL-50 dashboard UX improvements

**What was confusing / wrong:** `useUnitGeneration` `GenerationParams` was strictly typed to only 5 action types and 4 optional fields — it did not support passing arbitrary body fields to the edge function. The plan assumed it might. Also, `supabase/functions/CLAUDE.md` didn't document `last_section_topic` or `cycle_recap`.
**File/folder affected:** `src/hooks/useUnitGeneration.tsx`, `supabase/functions/CLAUDE.md`, `src/hooks/CLAUDE.md`
**What I did:** Extended `GenerationParams` with `cycle_recap` action + `last_section_topic` field. Updated all three CLAUDE.md files to reflect the new 6-action support and `last_section_topic` behavior.
**Status:** Fixed

## 2026-03-13 — RAL-50-fix: transient stale cache + missing sequence computation

**What was confusing / wrong:** Two bugs made the `up_to_date` + activeCycle screen appear unchanged for sections 1–4. (1) `nextSectionType` was only sourced from the pre-gen unit — if no pre-gen existed yet, it was null and the subtitle fell back to the generic "Continue current cycle". (2) `lastSectionTopic`/`lastSectionType` were null during the transient `up_to_date` state after feedback submission — the stale query cache from the `pending_feedback` branch had nulls for those fields, and by the time the refetch returned correct values, the pre-gen unit was ready and the state had already transitioned back to `pending_feedback`.
**File/folder affected:** `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`
**What I did:** (1) Added `buildSectionSeq` helper mirroring the edge function's section sequence logic; compute `nextSectionType` from `nonBonusCount` as a fallback when no pre-gen unit exists. (2) Added `lastCompletedTopic`/`lastCompletedType` local state — saved from `pendingUnit` in `handleFeedback` before clearing, used as fallbacks in the derivation lines, reset in `selectPillar`.
**Status:** Fixed
