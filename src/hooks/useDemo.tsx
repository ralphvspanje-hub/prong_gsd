No single service is responsible for\n2. Only appear under specific load patterns\n3. Cannot be predicted from individual service specifications\n\n## Strategies for Management\n\n- **Observability**: Distributed tracing reveals emergent patterns\n- **Chaos Engineering**: Deliberately introduce faults to surface hidden behaviors\n- **Circuit Breakers**: Contain cascading effects\n- **Load Shedding**: Graceful degradation under pressure\n\n## Practical Exercise\n\nMap your current architecture. Identify three points where emergent behavior could arise. For each, describe what monitoring you'd need to detect it early.",
