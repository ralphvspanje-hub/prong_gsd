              Most career advice still talks about T-shaped people — deep in one domain, broad across others. Marc Andreessen and others argued that T-shaped was the model for a more stable era.
            </p>

            <p>
              Today, jobs merge. Domains collapse into each other. The engineer needs product sense. The product manager needs to understand systems. The leader needs to think like a technologist.
            </p>

            <p>
              The new shape isn't T. It's E. Or F. Or a fork — multiple deep tines growing from a shared foundation.

            <p className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground">
              A Prong.

            <p>
              ProngGSD is built on that idea. Not one deep skill. Not shallow breadth. A deliberate set of growing tines — each one strategic, each one connected, each one built through focused daily practice.
            </p>

            <p>
              One task per day. One block at a time. Compounding over weeks into something that actually changes what you can do.
            </p>

            <p>
              You don't need to know everything. You need to know the right things — deeply — and keep adding tines.

              The T-shape is the past; multiple is the future. Broaden your horizons, but dig deep into two or three distinct fields. It's where these areas overlap that your greatest ambition becomes reality.
